Tutorial
========

If you immediately want to explore ``lammps-cython`` you can use the
interactive notebooks provided by binder. They only require a web
browser and have full demonstrations of ``lammps-cython``.

I will get a nice document written up soon! But the notebooks should
be a nearly full demonstration of what is possible and I am putting
the most effort there for now.

In these notebooks there are some important files.
  - benchmarks are provided for many of the functions that may take some time.
  - basic show how to use the basic features of lammps-cython

The benchmarks are especially helpful as they show what the expected
performance impact will be of using ``lammps-cython``.
