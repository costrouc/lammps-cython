   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to lammps-cython's documentation!
=========================================

Welcome to the lammps-cython wrapper documentation. To get started I
recommend you checkout the :doc:`installation` instructions and then
walk through the :doc:`tutorial`. The installation can be as easy as
``docker pull`` of ``conda install``. Full reference documentation is
available in the :doc:`modindex` section. The pythonic api heavily
borrows from `HOOMD <https://codeblue.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/>`_ but
hopefully the community settles on a universal api for molecular
dynamics.

 - Full MPI support
 - Pythonic API inspired by `HOOMD <https://codeblue.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/>`_
 - Supports Python 2 and 3
 - Heavily documented and tested
 - Elimination of unnecessary file I/O

If you immediately want to explore ``lammps-cython`` you can use the
interactive notebooks provided by binder. They only require a web
browser.
